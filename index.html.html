<p>I am currently learning to code with
  <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/">Code First Girls.</a>
  Going over everything from how the internet works, to creating
  websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8
  weeks! Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good
  reasons why...</P>

<ol>
  <li> You can understand what is going on 'under the hood'</li>
  <li> Not have to rely on someone else for a quick prototype website!</li>
  <li>It's fun!</li>
</ol>

<h3>
  <strong> What do you need to create a website? </strong></h3>

<p> Not much! </p>

<ul>
  <li>A computer (always a good start) </li>
<li>A text editor (I am using atom)</li>
<li>A web browser (I am using chrome)</li>
<li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files </li>
</ul>
